# Guerrilla Web Page Design
Assignment: Create a one-page website in 8 hours.

## Assignment

Your coach assigns you to a project.
Create and deploy before 5PM a one-pager that looks better and communicates more clearly than their current site, 
And don't forget to make it responsive ;)

Feel free to do this excercise however you want. 
So use a template, a framework, write it from the ground up. We don't care, but have a site ready by the end of the day.

TLDR;   - make a web page
        - time is 8 hours
        - has to be more clear than current site
        - add responsiveness
        - use whatever tools you deem necessary
        - have the site ready at the end of the day

## Getting started

The website I had to improve can be found here:

https://bormshuis.wordpress.com/

It is a site from a small museum in Merksem.
The site is unclear and the home page is way too long.

I decided to take a look at existing templates to get inspiration.
I ended up at **html5 UP** and started from a template.
